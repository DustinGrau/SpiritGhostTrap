# Spirit Ghost Trap Mods

These are my personal modifications to the Spirit Halloween (aka. Deluxe Ghost Trap) to provide motorized doors and custom lights and sounds using an [ItsyBitsy Feather M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3727). It also supports a [portable laser projector](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KLZNR2Y/) which is triggered as part of the trap-opening sequence.

Audio - Raw audio files used for sampling/sequencing.

Code - The contents to be uploaded to the ItsyBitsy Feather M0 microcontroller.

Models - STL files for augmenting the shell of the Ghost Trap.
